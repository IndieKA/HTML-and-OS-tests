        <h1>Indie's Help Request / Forum Page Info</h1>
        <h2>About 3 months ago I had left Khan Academy mainly because of chores, and I had summer camp, which really stunk. Soon after a while I had returned in late August to check on and see how things are doing.</h2>
        <h2>I had seen all my friend's profiles. They were all exceeding in quality and formation of their programs, and I asked myself, "Should I rejoin KA?" The question was harder than I thought, mainly because I had a bad reputation of oversocializing here (meaning I would be on for HOURS at a time.)</h2>
        <h2>This topic brought a lot of attention from others. Some said "No way dude. You've been doing programming too much.", but some said "Go for it!" My final decision was, "Okay", with a minimum of an hour a day. Reasonable, right?</h2>
        <h2>Now I'm back on Khan Academy and I'm going to start working on new programs and games again. But I can't always do it alone. I'm looking for collaborators of all ages to help me with new games as I am taking a new path to success.</h2>
