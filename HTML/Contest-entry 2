<div id = "caption">What Species Did I See?</div>
<p>So for Contest: So Many Species, I decided not to just make a program with the species I observed, but a poem out of them! How cool is that? NOTE: I'm not a good poetry writer. This is one of the first times I have tested out poetry.<strong> Note: You can hover over the poems. Just put your cursor over it.</strong></p>
<h1>First Section: The Animals I saw</h1>
<div class = "boX">
<p>When I looked outside,</p>
<p>I noticed a small vibe,</p>
<p>There I saw a small bird by the side,</p>
<p>Sitting calmly as I spied.</p>
<p>Then I turned to my back</p>
<p>Only to hear one big howl</p>
<p>That howl came from a dog</p>
<p>Who was as fat as a bog!</p>
<p>But then I heard a big gallop</p>
<p>Oh my, I saw a horse who galloped!</p>
<p>And then I realized</p>
<p>What a wide species of animals</p>
<p>Luckily they aren't cannibals!</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<h2>Second Section: The Plants I saw</h2>
<div class = "boX">
    <p>When I looked outside</p>
    <p>I noticed a redwood tree so high,</p>
    <p>It almost reached the sky!</p>
    <p>I also saw a sunflower</p>
    <p>Who sadly was as dirty as gunpowder</p>
    <p>Then, a weed appeared</p>
    <p>I think it was growing as a seed.</p>
    <p>I also saw a rose flower</p>
    <p>So beautiful, it may have taken a shower!</p>
    
</div>
<div id = "caption">Stats</div>
<p>There were (3 animals here and 3 plants here) here</p>
<p>The most in population were (Couldn't tell really, but for animals it was horses. I think I saw a bunch of them.)</p>
<p>The least in population were (Dogs and roses. There were only one of them, sadly.)</p>
<p></p>
<div id = "caption">Other Facts</div>
<p>I saw animals that could live on a farm. </p>
